    category: 'Research',
    description:
      "Despite accelerated technological advances, a few real-world NP complex problems still elude physicists, such as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), Knapsack Problem, Graph Colouring, and Vehicle Routing. The TSP is a classic combinatorial optimization problem with applications in various fields. Our group project aimed to solve the TSP using five algorithms: Firefly Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm with Crossover Search, Genetic Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning, Ant Colonisation Algorithm, and Cuckoo Algorithm. We thoroughly reviewed five research documents for insights and methodologies. The Firefly Algorithm optimized the shortest tour based on light intensity, while the Genetic Algorithm with Crossover Search used genetic operations to evolve tours. Reinforcement Learning enhanced the Genetic Algorithm by learning from past experiences. The Ant Colonisation Algorithm mimicked ants' foraging behavior to find paths, and the Cuckoo Algorithm simulated brood parasitism for solution variety. We evaluated these algorithms on resolution quality, convergence speed, and computational efficiency, finding that the Genetic Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning and the Ant Colonisation Algorithm excelled in high-quality solutions and computational resources. This project provided a comprehensive study and practical implementation of various algorithms for solving the TSP, offering valuable insights into optimization techniques and contributing to ongoing research in combinatorial optimization and algorithm design.",
